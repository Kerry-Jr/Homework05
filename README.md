# 05 Homework 5- Work day planner
...

Homework 05 UCB bootcamp - Created a day planner from 9am to 5pm that allows for an entry on each "todo" line to be saved.  The text inputs are color coded to show current hour, hours previous, and hours not yet passed till 5pm.  Very simple and elegant work day planner that uses jQuery, vanilla js, and a new js library moment. Moment.js is for time keeping and makes tracking and displaying time easier and more user friendly than plain JS. 
## Building the project

Using various front-end technologies I created a  day planner that a user can jot down todo's from 9am to 5pm.  This day planner was built with new JS library we did not study in class but rather had to research it ourselves.  Moment.js provides the developer an easier way to interact with time in their code.

## Troubleshooting

Mainly figuring out the logic for the user experience.  The time in this app is key. Moment.js keep's track of user's geolocation time. It allows developers to use time to their advantage by making it simple and intuitive. Psuedo-coding and refactoring was key to building this app. Receiving important help from the TA's and my tutor were necessary to fully understand the flow of the project. This project had it's difficulties by the way of using the correct logic ("computer speak") and making it make sense in "human speak". Spent hours researching javascript terms and methods to fully understand exaclty how it works and why.


## HOW I BUILT AND TECH USED

1.) Declared multiple variables 
2.) For loops, if statements, and DOM manipulation.
3.) HTML
4.) CSS
5.) JAVASCRIPT
6.) Local storage
7.) Moment.js
8.) jQuery
